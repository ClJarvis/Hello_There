# Is it time to replace Hello World?

It's a common practice to code the phrase "Hello World!", to the screen the first time you use a new language or program. I wrote about this in an early blog post. But am updating not with syntax highlighting.

Here's how "Hello World!" is created in a few languages. 

HTML
```html
<title>Hello World</title>
```
```HTML
<H2>Hello World!</h2>
```
JavaScript
```javascript
console.log("Hello World!")
```


C#
```C#
Console.WriteLine("Hello World"!)
```
Python


```python
print ("Hello World!")

def hello():
  return "Hello World!"
hello()
```

Well time and frameworks change, is it time to replace Hello World? What would be a suitable replacement? 

What would make a dev smile to see on screen?

## Hello There!

HTML
```html
<title>Hello There</title>
```
```HTML
<H2>Hello There!</h2>
```
JavaScript
```javascript
console.log("Hello There!")
```
Python

```python
print("Hello There!")

def hello_function():
    print("Hello there!")
hello_function()
```

See it looks good. So here I plan to add Hello There as I learn new languages.
